# Fonts

iMWriting fonts are renames of the Open Font License reserved iAWriting font
which was itself derived from IBM's Plex. The monospaced and duospaced versions
are included here, but mono is obviously best for terminal usage. They're
patched with nerd font icons for LunarVim and other TUI programs' benefit.
